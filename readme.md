Code possibly (probably) broken - just a heads up

Originally, this program was meant to show you a specific artist's music that you haven't listened to. It worked by finding a list of all the songs that you have listened to from last.fm, then find (Set of artists songs)-(set of songs you've listened to by that artist)

Now, the plan is to find the artists that you listen the most music from (maybe top 5?) and retrieve a short list of all of their top music that you haven't listened to, and add to a playlist
